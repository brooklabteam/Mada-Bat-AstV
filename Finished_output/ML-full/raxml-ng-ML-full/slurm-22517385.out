ERROR: CPU core oversubscription detected! RAxML-NG will terminate now to avoid wasting resources.
NOTE:  Details: https://github.com/amkozlov/raxml-ng/wiki/Parallelization#core-oversubscription
NOTE:  You can use '--force perf_threads' to disable this check, but ONLY if you are 200% sure this is a false alarm!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
MPI_ABORT was invoked on rank 0 in communicator MPI_COMM_WORLD
with errorcode -1.

NOTE: invoking MPI_ABORT causes Open MPI to kill all MPI processes.
You may or may not see output from other processes, depending on
exactly when Open MPI kills them.
